Next week the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) community is having the biggest event of the year, the [Rails Conf 2019](https://railsconf.com/). We participated on previous editions of this conference but this time we have the honor to be in the speakers side of it. We'll be teaching you what we're best at: [Rails Upgrades](https://fastruby.io/blog/tags/upgrades).

At [Fast Ruby](https://fastruby.io/) we have been doing Rails Upgrades for many years. That allowed us to work on all kind of projects. From tiny [MVP's](https://fastruby.io/minimum-viable-product) to huge [monolith](https://fastruby.io/monolith) applications.

During the 2-hour [workshop](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-776) you will learn a proven Rails upgrade process for major and minor version changes of Rails.
We will teach you how you can [evaluate](https://fastruby.io/blog/upgrade-rails/legacy-rails-silently-judging-you.html) a Rails application before consider upgrading it. What tools you should us to make the upgrade easier. What are the main things that you should address on every upgrade. And much more.
You will leave this workshop with a roadmap to upgrade your Rails application.

If you're going to the Rails Conf and you are interested on attending our workshop, you can book your place [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-upgrade-rails-101-the-roadmap-to-smooth-upgrades-tickets-60333391799).

Hope we can see you there!
